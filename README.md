No centralized view of regional sales performance and customer demand patterns.

Inability to monitor delivery partner efficiency and logistics KPIs.

Disconnected data made it hard for teams to make fast, data-driven decisions.

Identify bottlenecks in delivery performance.

Track daily orders, revenue trends, and product sales across regions.
